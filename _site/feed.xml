  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Problem and Idea&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wake up between 5-6am every morning. And I am trying to be as productive as possible over the next 3-4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But often happens that the morning is over, and I have the feeling that I have done nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to prevent this, I started to log every activity that I did on a notepad and the time that I did it in. When the morning was over, I could look at this log and inspect my activities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realised that I could build a product that simplifies this process a little bit&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&quot;hr-w-25&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Design &amp; Build&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h5&gt;Design&lt;/h5&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to simply log my activities and categorise them as Productive or Unproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once done, I also wanted to view have a timeline where I could inspect all my activities in a nice and clear manner&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h5&gt;Build&lt;/h5&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built the product livestreaming it on Twitch. This was a pretty cool experience, but still a bit stressful, as never before people have watched me code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would love to continue doing this in the future, but this time with commentary. It would be a good material for YouTube also, as it could show inspiring Software Developers what's coding really like.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Where did my time go was built using ReactJS, as this was the fastest solution for me&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&quot;hr-w-25&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Ship&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As soon as I hit MVP stage, which took me about 5 hours of programming, I decided to stop working on it and share it to my Twitter account&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have several additional features I plan to include in the near future:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ability to edit Activities&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Drag and drop activities&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;More statistics in the Timeline page, e.g. Percentage of productive vs unproductive tasks; longest task&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
