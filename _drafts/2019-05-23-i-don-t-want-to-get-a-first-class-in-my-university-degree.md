## Anyone can achieve a high grade, given they spend enough time revising

Some folks say that some people are confined to certain bounds, and no-matter what you do, you won't be able to escape it. If you are not a runner, you won't be able to run a marathon. If you are not born smart, you won't be able to perform well in school.

Everyone can be smart. Everyone can be rich. Everyone can be happy. 

I refuse to believe that there is a some kind of limit that people reach. I am convinced that everyone can achieve whatever they want, given enough time, dedication and effort is put in.

If you are in university, this means that you have already proven that you have the mental capacity to succeed in the next step of your education.

I believe that everyone can succeed, given they put the necessary time **AND** focus to achieve their goals. Yes, there might be some people, who have been gifted with the ability to do well in education, just like there are people who are genetically made for the NBA.

I am not one of them and most likely, you are not either. But dedicate your life to basketball, and you will get in the NBA. Dedicate hundreds of hours of studying, and you will get a first.

## I don't want to do a postgraduate degree

Short and simple. If I wanted to do a postgraduate degree, I would need to get a first class to have a competitive advantage. You bet that then I wouldn't be writing this article.

Just like a lot of new university students, I had plans to become a PhD student. Thankfully, this dream is long forgotten. I mean it!

## 2:1 is sufficient for my career

I have been a software developer for the last one year and I am extremely happy to continue being one after I graduate. I already have a full-time position secured, working for [Wildgoose](https://wearewildgoose.com/uk/ "Wildgoose") as a Web Developer. Even if I had to apply for a graduate position in software development, I wouldn't need a first class in 98% of my applications. I am not even sure why it's not 100%, I am yet to come to an application that requires a first.

From my own personal experience, as well as talking to hiring managers within the industry, a good grade from your degree is not that relevant and you surely won't get any special treatment if you have one. Your other skills - past projects, your to-do mentality and your perspicacity are so much more important than doing good in exams.

## I focused on building my skills, portfolio and network

Earlier I mentioned that I believe that anyone can get a high grade given they put in the hours. Therefore, you might ask yourself why I didn't do this.

There is a twist. We only have limited number of high [ROI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) hours in a day. Throughout my final year of university, I could have either spent these hours on revision to get a first, or I could have spent it improving my development skills and my earning potentials. Which one looks more attractive to a guy in his early 20s who is hungry for success?

The latter gave me a lot of positive attributes in the short term - flow, skills, accomplishment, satisfaction and cashflow.

In addition, I will use these skills I learnt throughout this year as a foundation for a career. It's all important.

## It's too much pressure

I am writing this article during my exam season. And I feel the pressure. But it wouldn't be nearly as big of a pressure if I wanted to get a first class, because I don't have to study the whole module to get a relatively good great. I can allow myself to make mistakes and not to be perfect.
