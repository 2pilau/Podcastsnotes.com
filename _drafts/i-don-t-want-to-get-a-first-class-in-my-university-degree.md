I am not aiming for a first class.

I want to get a 2:1. Here's why

## I don't need it for my career

I have been a software developer for the last one year and I am extremely happy to continue being one after I graduate. I already have a full-time position secured, working for [Wildgoose](https://wearewildgoose.com/uk/ "Wildgoose") as a Web Developer. However, even if I had to apply for a graduate position in software development, I wouldn't need a first class.

From my own personal experience, as well as talking to hiring managers within the industry, a good grade in university is close to irrelevant and you won't get any special treatment from having a good grade. Your other skills - past projects, your to-do mentality and your perspicacity are so much more important than doing good in exams.

In fact, doing good in exams doesn't help you in a software development position. In real life programming, you use Google **all the time.**

## I don't want to do a postgraduate degree

This one is short and simple. If I wanted to do a postgraduate degree, where I need to get a first class to have an advantage, then I wouldn't be writing this article. 

Thankfully (and I deeply mean it), this dream is long forgotten.

## I focused on building my skills and resume

## It's too much pressure
