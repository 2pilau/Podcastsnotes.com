I am not aiming for a first class.

I want to get a 2:1. Here's why

## Anyone can get a first, given enough time is spent studying

To some that might seem as a controversial statement. You might say that some people are made to be good at first, while others are destined to fail.

I refuse to believe it. If you are in university, this means that you have already proven that you have the mental capability for you to succeed in this step of your education.

I believe that everyone can succeed, given they put the necessary time **AND** focus to achieve their goals. Yes, there might be some people, who have been gifted with the ability to do well in education, just like there are people who are genetically made for the NBA.

I am not one of them and most likely, you are not either. But with enough focus, time and consistency, we can get in the NBA.

## I focused on building my skills, resume and bank balance

We have established that the majority of us can get a first class given we put the hard work in.

Here is the twist. We only have limited number of high [ROI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) hours in a day. Throughout my final year of university, I could have either spent these hours on revision to get a first, or I could have spent it improving my development skills. I chose the latter.

The latter gave me a lot of positive attributes in the short term - flow, skills, accomplishment, satisfaction and cashflow.

In addition, I will use these skills I learnt throughout this year as a foundation for a career. Important stuff.

## 2:1 is sufficient for my career

I have been a software developer for the last one year and I am extremely happy to continue being one after I graduate. I already have a full-time position secured, working for [Wildgoose](https://wearewildgoose.com/uk/ "Wildgoose") as a Web Developer. However, even if I had to apply for a graduate position in software development, I wouldn't need a first class.

From my own personal experience, as well as talking to hiring managers within the industry, a good grade in university is close to irrelevant and you won't get any special treatment from having a good grade. Your other skills - past projects, your to-do mentality and your perspicacity are so much more important than doing good in exams.

In fact, doing good in exams doesn't help you in a software development position. In real life programming, you use Google **all the time.**

## I don't want to do a postgraduate degree

This reason is short and simple. If I wanted to do a postgraduate degree, where I need to get a first class to have an advantage, then I wouldn't be writing this article. 

Thankfully (and I deeply mean it), this dream is long forgotten.

## It's too much pressure

I am writing this article during my exam season. And I feel the pressure. But it wouldn't be nearly as big of a pressure if I wanted to get a first class, because I don't have to study the whole module to get a relatively good great. I can allow myself to make mistakes and not to be perfect.
