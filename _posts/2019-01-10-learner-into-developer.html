  <h2>A short history of me the learner</h2>
  <p>In highschool, I studied a CS subject for one year. I hated it! Studying all of this CS high-level theory stuff was not what I was expecting from a coding subject.</p>
  <p>I dropped out at the end of the year and didn't looked back. Decided to go into maths/finance instead.</p>
  <p>Forward to 3rd year of my Maths degree (2017), I wanted to give programming another chance. But didn't know where to start.</p>
  <p>So I decided to start from <u>everywhere</u>. I started reading books and taking courses on <b>Visual Studio, Android, Java, PHP, SQL, WordPress development, Python and PyGame (because why not create games in Python?).</b></p>
  <p>Damn, I had no idea what I was supposed to do. Stuff had to change quickly, because summer internship application were already open.</p>

  <h2>Define your end goal</h2>

  <p>Do you want to</p>
  <ul>
    <li>change careers?</li>
    <li>get your first software developer internship?</li>
    <li>become an indie maker?</li>
    <li>code as a hobby?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Think why you want to code. Once you know how important coding is for your career (and life, let's be honest), then you can decide how many hours per day/week you should dedicate on becoming a software developer.</p>
  
  <h2>Follow people who are already there</h2>

  <p>Start following people who are already where you want to be. Twitter and Reddit are great places for this, where plenty of people can give you a daily dose of solid advice and motivation.</p>
  <p><b>I am still the new kid on the block, but you can <a href="https://twitter.com/kris_bogdanov" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a> - I document my journey of being a self taught full-stack developer and making personal projects. Hope I can give you the extra motivation you need!</b></p>
  
  <h2>Pick specific stack and stick to it (for now)</h2>

  <p>If you want to be a front-end developer, focus on the things that will make you a front-end developer - HTML, CSS, design, React (or other frameworks).</p>
  <p>If you want to be a mobile developer, focus on react-native or Swift/Android.</p>
  <p>Massive shortcut to making the transition from learner to developer is not wasting time on things you will never use.</p>
  <p>Remember all the languages I listed above? I spent months on courses and books, but I remember exactly <b>nothing</b> from them.</p>
  <p>Make peace with yourself that it is ok not to know everything. Dan Abramov, the co-creator of create-react-app and the creator of Redux, <a href="https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/" target="_blank">doesn't know bunch of things</a>. And it seems that he is fine with that.</p>
  <p>Focus on the things that matter.</p>

  <h2>It's time to leave the tutorial paradise</h2>

  <p>Tutorials are great in the beginning, but at some point they become counter productive.</p>
  <p>So many times I find a tutorial for an awesome project, I start watching it, but halfway through, I realise that I have just been copypasta from the video without actually learning anything.</p>
  <p>But that's not the biggest problem. There is no danger in tutorials - they are perfect examples, where nothing goes wrong.</p>
  <p><b>95% of development is problem solving!</b></p>
  <p>Tutorials are great for learning the basics of new language/framework or when you are stuck on a problem, but they will only get you so far. To go beyond tutorials, you need to start building projects.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Coding == making things</h2>

  <p>Once you start creating things, you will find watching tutorials just for the sake of watching tutorials so boring.</p>
  <p>In my opinion, creating projects is the catalyst to becoming a developer. And even once you are a developer, it's an instrument that keeps the passion going.</p>
  <p>My opinion on development changed once I started working on my own little projects. All of the sudden, I wasn't following someone's tutorial - instead, I was on my own, making decisions on every single line of code and solving every little puzzle along the way.</p>
  <p>Before I got my first software developer internship, I was <a href="https://www.kris.ventures/personal-projects-before-first-internship/" target="_blank">making projects all the time</a>. Even though they were basic projects, I still got the thrill of figuring out every problem thrown at me.</p>
  <p><b>Code, bug, Google, fix, repeat.</b> Personal projects are the best simulator to what it's like being a full-time developer as well as teaching you extremely valuable skills.</p>
