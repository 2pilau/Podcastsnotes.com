<p>Internship interviews can be a nerve-racking experience. Getting an interview is a great achievement by itself (since I was getting in majority of my applications in the first/second stage), so you don't really want to screw this over.</p>
<p>Here's a 5 day plan on how to prepare for the interview.</p>

<div>
  <h2>5 days before - get to know the company</h2>
  <p>Your interview will end in a disaster if you don't do this. I know this for a fact from personal experience.</p>
  <p>I was very very unprepared for my first ever internship interview. I didn't know what the company does - only that it was in the pharmaceutical business.</p>
  <p>I through that they produce the drugs in the company, but they made it clear that they don't during the interview. A simple research would have shown that. No matter what I did afterwards, my chances of getting an offer was 0.</p>
  <p>Spend 30 minutes on their website and write down key goals and values. Think about how you can incorporate that in your answers, which you will practice in the following days.</p>
  <p>Check if they have a blog, social media or podcast - check out their content to extra insight about the company.</p>
  <p>Employers love that you have spent time researching the company (instead of doing what I did in my first interview).</p>

  <h2>4 days before - research the role</h2>
  <p>Make sure you can talk about the role you are applying to. Make sure you can explain how your degree and other past experiences will help you throughout this internship.</p>
  <p>Look at your job description and write down brief summary of every point. Google any terms you haven't heard before (employers love to throw fancy terms in the job description).</p>
  <p>In addition, some of the required competencies might be there as well. Write them down - this will be useful for the next task.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>3 days before - competency based questions</h2>
  <p>Competency based questions - we all hate them. Unfortunately, most companies use them in their hiring process. The fact remains - we need to learn how to answer them effectively.</p>
  <p>Depending on the role, you will be asked different questions. Communication skills? Analytical skills? Team work?</p>
  <p>Go back to the job description and see if they have mentioned any required competencies - they will most likely ask you about them in the interview.</p>
  <p>Next, you should answer them using bullet points. Don't try to write full sentences and memorise them word for word. <b>It will not work.</b> You will forget them once the interview starts.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>2 days before - study your CV and cover letter</h2>
  <p>This is harder than you think.</p>
  <p>You need to talk freely about everything you have done in your past jobs and university. You will also have to link them to the competency questions. In your head, think how every past experience has helped you develop communication, team work, meeting deadlines and so on.</p>
  <p>A useful technique to learn is the <a href="https://theinterviewguys.com/star-method/" target="_blank">STAR method</a>.</p>
  <p>Doing this will greatly improve the quality of your answers and make you more confident.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>1 day before - write down questions you want to ask.</h2>
  <p>At the end of every single interview, the interviewers will ask you "Do you have any questions for us?".</p>
  <p><b>NEVER reply with a no.</b> Employers want to know that you are interested in the job and that you are hungry for more information than what they have provided.</p>
  <p>You can think of questions yourself, but these are the ones I usually ask:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Will I work with people outside my team, or is the job concentrated within my team?</li>
    <li>Is the company involved in any volunteering and any extra-curricular activities? Can I also be involved?</li>
    <li>Do you provide any additional training for your interns/employees?</li>
    <li>As employees of <i>company name</i>, could you summarise what is your experience working here? (this is my favourite as it puts them outside of their comfort zone)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember, the best questions you can ask are ones that you one to ask.</p>
  <p>Lastly, don't forget to iron your clothes. Look nice and presentable.</p>
</div>

<p class="text-center w-75 mx-auto text-muted">Finally remember, if they didn't want you for the role, they wouldn't consider you for an interview. Most important thing is to show that you are a nice person to spend an entire day with.</p>
