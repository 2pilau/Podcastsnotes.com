  <h2>Our Airbnb</h2>
  <p>Our Airbnb was situated in the center of the town center. We couldn't have gotten a better location.</p>
  <p>It was 5 minutes away from the town center and NDK and 20 minutes away from our co-working space.</p>
  <p>There were also plenty of restaurants, bars and breakfast choices, so I never felt that I'm missing something</p>
  <p>Here is a <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/18790438?source_impression_id=p3_1563625593_6SI10eqdDvdlsqXZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listing</a> of the apartment on Airbnb - highly recommend it if you are staying in the city.</p>

  <h2>Co-working and cafés</h2>
  <p>Our co-working space was called Soho - a big 3 story artsy house situated in the town center. It included both offices and hot-desking.</p>
  <p>It was disappointing to see that the space focused more on offices than hot-desking/permanent desks. There was only one area of the house (plus the garden) which was designated for co-working, which probably has a capacity of about 20 people.</p>
  <p>The space didn't have a lot of free spaces, and the space was often noisy and not well air-conditioned.</p>
  <p>Next time when I'm back in Sofia, I will explore different co-working spaces such as Betahouse.</p>

  <p>I also found several coffee shops where I worked often.</p>

  <p>There are plenty of laptop friendly coffee shops. They weren't too busy as well!</p>

  <h2>What did we do?</h2>
  <p><b>Living in Sofia:</b> we didn't do much touristy stuff in Sofia, as I have been here many times, so did Hannah one time about 2 years ago.</p>
  <p>I also started my full-time job whenever right when I came to Bulgaria, so I needed some time to adjust to this change.</p>
  <p>On the first day we came, we stumbled on a concert in the town center.</p>

  <h2>Where are we going next?</h2>
  <p>Next, we are off to Malaga, Spain (well, I'm writing this article from here). Unsurprisingly, Bulgaria was much cheaper than England.</p>
  <p>I'm excited to see how this compares to Malaga. Malaga is a tourist city with a high standard of living, so I expect that the numbers will be higher.</p>
