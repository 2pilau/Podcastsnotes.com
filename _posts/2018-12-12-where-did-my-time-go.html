    <h2>Problem and Idea</h2>
    <p>I wake up between 5-6am every morning. And I am trying to be as productive as possible over the next 3-4 hours.</p>
    <p>But often happens that the morning is over, and I have the feeling that I have done nothing.</p>
    <p>In order to prevent this, I started to log every activity that I did on a notepad and the time that I did it in. When the morning was over, I could look at this log and inspect my activities</p>
    <p>I realised that I could build a product that simplifies this process a little bit</p>

    <h2>Design & Build</h2>
    <h5>Design</h5>
    <p>I wanted to simply log my activities and categorise them as Productive or Unproductive.</p>
    <p>Once done, I also wanted to view have a timeline where I could inspect all my activities in a nice and clear manner</p>
    <h5>Build</h5>
    <p>I built the product livestreaming it on Twitch. This was a pretty cool experience, but still a bit stressful, as never before people have watched me code.</p>
    <p>I would love to continue doing this in the future, but this time with commentary. It would be a good material for YouTube also, as it could show inspiring Software Developers what's coding really like.</p>

    <p>Where did my time go was built using ReactJS, as this was the fastest solution for me</p>

    <h2>Ship</h2>
    <p>As soon as I hit MVP stage, which took me about 5 hours of programming, I decided to stop working on it and share it to my Twitter account</p>
    <p>I have several additional features I plan to include in the near future:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ability to edit Activities</li>
      <li>Drag and drop activities</li>
      <li>More statistics in the Timeline page, e.g. Percentage of productive vs unproductive tasks; longest task</li>
    </ul>
